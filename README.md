Natural Language proccessing project focus on hebrew corpus analysis. In my Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, I focused on building a Hebrew text corpus derived from protocols of the Knesset's plenary sessions and committee meetings.

Here are the main steps of the project:

Preprocessing: I extracted the speakers' sentences from the protocols by identifying patterns and structured text within the documents. Tokenization: I divided the sentences into tokens, which are basic linguistic units such as words, using NLP tools tailored for Hebrew. Corpus Construction: I organized the structured text and tokens into a corpus ready for analysis. Corpus Analysis: I analyzed the corpus to examine various linguistic properties, including verifying whether the corpus adheres to Zipf's law, which defines the relationship between word frequency and its rank in the corpus.

Throughout the project, I utilized NLP tools and techniques to ensure the accuracy and quality of the processed data, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the Hebrew language in a parliamentary context.
